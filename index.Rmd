title: "About me"
---

I am an MPH candidate'26 in the Department of Population and Family Health at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. At Mailman, I am also getting targeted training in research design and data analysis through the Public Health Research Methods certificate. 

Prior to joining the Mailman community, I worked in grant management and operations of global health research funds, as well as coordinating NIH-funded research in HIV prevention and management in the greater New York City area and abroad at Cl√≠nica de Familia La Romana in the Dominican Republic. 

I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Psychology from New York University.
