I am an MPH candidate'26 in the [Department of Population and Family Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/departments/population-family-health) at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health. At Mailman, I am also getting targeted training in advanced research design and data analysis through the [Public Health Research Methods certificate](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/academics/degrees/master-public-health/certificates/public-health-research-methods). 

I received my Bachelor of Science in Applied Psychology from New York University, where I gained experience in research design and data analysis in the social sciences. 

Prior to joining the Mailman community, I worked in grant management and operations at [Global TIES for Children](https://globaltiesforchildren.nyu.edu/), as well as coordinating NIH-funded research in HIV prevention and management in the greater New York City area and abroad at [Cl√≠nica de Familia La Romana](https://clinicadefamilia.org.do/en/) in the Dominican Republic.
